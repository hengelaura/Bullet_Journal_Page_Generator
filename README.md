This code is intended to generate the pages necessary for a bullet journal containing a single years calendar

Page layouts include:

    Year title page
    Annual calendar
    Month title pages
    Monthly spread (2 pages)
    Weekly spread (2 pages)



Future Developments I'd like to include are:
     User Interface (GUI)
     Import page backgrounds
     Allow different page sizes
     Options for printers that can/cannot do back to back printing
